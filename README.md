# Let Do This app

This is a challenge proposed by [Wrangler](https://wrangler.hackpad.com/).

Simple web application that can be used to manage lists of things to do. 

A user of the application should be able to create a list, add arbitrary items to it, that haven't yet been done, and edit these lists when items have been completed
